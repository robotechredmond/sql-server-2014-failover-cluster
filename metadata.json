Azure Files is configured as a shared storage location for each cluster node.  In addition to these VMs, the following additional Azure resources are also configured: Internal Load Balancer, Storage accounts, Azure Files Shares.  To configure the cluster within each VM, PowerShell DSC is leveraged.  For Active Directory support, existing Active Directory domain controllers should already be deployed on the existing VNET.",
